AI Supply Chain Optimization Assistant (Retail) - Technical Documentation



1.0 Introduction

This document outlines the technical specifications and design of the AI Supply Chain Optimization Assistant, a multi-agent system designed to assist retail businesses in making data-driven decisions across key supply chain functions. The primary objective is to enhance proactive decision-making in demand forecasting, inventory allocation, and route planning.

2.0 Business Goal

The overarching business goal of this system is to empower retail businesses with intelligent and proactive decision-making capabilities within their supply chain operations. This directly translates to improved efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction.

3.0 Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

The initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the AI Supply Chain Optimization Assistant will encompass the following core functionalities:
3.1 Demand Forecasting: The system will be capable of forecasting demand at a granular product- and store-level.
3.2 Inventory Level Optimization: The system will generate suggestions for optimal inventory levels to maintain efficient stock management.
3.3 Route Planning Efficiency: The system will propose efficient delivery routes to minimize logistical overheads.
3.4 Action Summarization: The system will generate human-readable summaries of its insights and proposed actions.
4.0 Multi-Agent System Design

The AI Supply Chain Optimization Assistant is architected as a multi-agent system, with each agent specializing in a distinct aspect of supply chain optimization. The inter-agent communication and data flow are managed by an Orchestrator component.
Agent Name
Role
Tools/Models
Memory
Description
🔮 Demand Forecast Agent
Predict future sales
Time series models (Prophet, LSTM, XGBoost), LLM to explain spikes
Per SKU/store history
Responsible for forecasting demand by product, store, and date.
📦 Inventory Advisor Agent
Calculate optimal reorder levels
EOQ models, LLM summarization
Forecast + historical demand
Suggests optimal stock reorder quantities and safety stock levels.
🚚 Route Optimizer Agent
Optimize delivery path
OR-Tools, Google Maps API (mocked)
Delivery history
Identifies cost-effective delivery clusters and optimizes routes.
📊 Executive Summary Agent
Generate human-readable insights
LLM (OpenAI, Mixtral, Qwen)
Global context
Provides summarized insights on forecasts, risks, and recommendations.

5.0 Public Datasets

The system leverages several publicly available and realistic datasets for training, simulation, and validation purposes:
5.1 M5 Forecasting Dataset (Walmart):
Data Content: Daily sales data for over 3,000 Walmart products across 10 U.S. states over a five-year period.
Applicability: Utilized for time series forecasting at a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) level, geographic clustering analysis, and incorporating the impact of promotions and calendar events on demand.
5.2 US Retail Logistics Costs & Transit Data (Source: BTS.gov):
Data Content: Information pertaining to delivery costs, lead times, and freight distances.
Applicability: Employed to simulate variability in route costs and delivery delays, and to introduce realistic constraints into the routing optimization logic.
5.3 Retail Product Catalog Datasets (Source: OpenFoodFacts):
Applicability: Provides real product hierarchies and metadata, which can be used for generating embeddings and for creating example SKUs for route and inventory simulation scenarios.
6.0 Architecture Diagram

The system architecture is based on a central Orchestrator component that manages task routing and context sharing among the specialized agents.

6.1 Orchestrator: The Orchestrator acts as the central control unit, receiving user inputs, distributing tasks to the appropriate agents, and managing the flow of information and context between them.

6.2 Agent Interactions:
The Demand Forecast Agent processes data, potentially from the M5 Dataset, to generate forecasts.
The Inventory Advisor Agent utilizes the forecasts and historical demand to calculate optimal inventory levels.
The Route Optimizer Agent leverages data like distance matrices (potentially derived from US Retail Logistics Costs & Transit Data) and tools such as OR-Tools and mocked Google Maps API to determine efficient delivery paths.
The Executive Summary Agent receives global context and output from the other agents to synthesize a comprehensive, human-readable report.
6.3 Data Flow:
Input data, such as the M5 Dataset, is fed into the respective agents.
Intermediate outputs, like forecasts from the Demand Forecast Agent, are shared with downstream agents (e.g., Inventory Advisor Agent).
The Route Optimizer Agent might generate a distance matrix based on its processing.
Ultimately, the Executive Summary Agent compiles a "Combined Report" from the aggregated information provided by all agents.
